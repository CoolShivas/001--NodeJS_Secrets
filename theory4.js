 * Node.JS Installation :-

 * 
 * ------Setting up Development Environment :-
 * 
 * 
        Download Node.js
        Visual Studio Code :-
                            •Prettier
                            •Turn on Format on Save

 * 
 *  Installing Node.js and npm (FNM) :-
 * 
 * 
        • You can download Node.js from its official website. We will be using FNM in this course.
        
        • FNM (Fast Node Manager) is a command-line utility that enables developers to easily manage and switch between different versions of Node.js on their machines.

        • We are using v23.2.0 in this course, but all the content in this course will be valid for upcoming versions too.
 
        • If you don’t have winget on Windows, then you can also use chocolatey, or scoop to install FNM. Details are 
        mentioned here.

        • Of course, you need to install chocolatey or scoop first.

 *  REPL (Read-Eval Print Loop) :-
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * -----Introduction to REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) :-
 * 
    • It stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop or Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop. It’s an interactive programming environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code one statement at a time.

    • You can open your terminal and use node command.

    • You can use it to test simple JavaScript code similar to browser devtools.

    • Ctrl + C to exit out of it.


-------Each part of the acronym highlights a specific step in how the REPL works :-
 
    • Read: The REPL reads the user’s input (a single line or multiple lines of code) and parses it into a data structure
    that the JavaScript engine can understand.

    • Eval (Evaluate): The parsed input is evaluated (executed) by the JavaScript engine. If the input is a valid expression, the REPL computes the result.

    • Print: The result of the evaluated expression is printed back to the console so the user can see the output.
 
    • Loop: The process then loops back, waiting for the next input, and continues until the user exits
